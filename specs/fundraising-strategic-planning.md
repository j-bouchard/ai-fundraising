# Fundraising Strategic Planning

## Workflow

Using the fundraisingaimcp MCP server, develop a strategic fundraising plan that connects organizational goals to data-driven tactics.

**Understand Current State:**
- Review recent fundraising data analysis (reference prior analysis report if available, or query key metrics: total revenue, donor counts, retention rate, average gift, revenue by source)
- Identify current performance trends (growing/declining, strong/weak areas)
- Assess fundraising capacity (staff count, budget, technology from organizational context)

**Clarify Organizational Goals:**
- Prompt for or retrieve information about:
  - Annual revenue target
  - Program funding priorities
  - Growth vs sustainability focus
  - Timeline (1-year, 3-year, 5-year goals)
  - Any specific initiatives requiring funding
  - Board or leadership strategic priorities

**Gap Analysis:**
- Calculate the gap between current trajectory and stated goals
- Identify which donor segments must grow to reach targets
- Determine if goals are realistic given current resources and trends
- Flag any concerning trends that threaten goal achievement

**Strategic Recommendations:**
- Based on data patterns, recommend specific tactics:
  - If retention is low → propose stewardship program improvements
  - If average gift is declining → suggest upgrade strategies
  - If new donor acquisition is weak → recommend prospect development
  - If certain campaigns perform well → propose expansion
  - Match tactics to organizational capacity and timeline
- Prioritize recommendations by:
  - Potential revenue impact
  - Feasibility with current resources
  - Speed to implementation
  - Risk level

**Action Plan:**
- Create quarterly milestones toward annual goals
- Assign metrics to track for each strategic priority
- Suggest specific campaigns or initiatives to launch
- Identify donors/segments to target with each tactic
- Recommend any capacity building needs (staff, technology, training)

**Create a markdown strategic plan including:**
- Executive summary with goals and recommended path forward
- Current state assessment with key data points
- Gap analysis with clear metrics
- Prioritized strategic recommendations with rationale
- Quarterly action plan with specific tactics
- Success metrics to track progress
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies
